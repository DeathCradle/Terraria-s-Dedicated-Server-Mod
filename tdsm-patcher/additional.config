heartbeat=true

# Max client queue memory size. The limit of how much data is queued to be sent to a single client.
# [Integer] Default: 1024
# Recommended between 1024 and 4096.
# [Currently not working since 1.3]
#send-queue-quota=1024

# Allows bypassing of the slot queue mechanism when the server reaches the player limit.

#overlimit-slots=1

# Location of a PID file to maintain.
# Comment out if not using a PID file.

#	AUTH	= Player data is based upon player name and password
#	UUID	= Use the player UUID - Not recommended as a player may change this

# This allows guests to connect with their normal gear.
# Upon authentication the server will issue them with their registered data, overwriting anything extra they may have brought along.

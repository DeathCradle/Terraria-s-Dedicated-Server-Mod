This section contains the dump of our bin directories, and you could consider these as PreReleases.

We have now also started including the generated tdsm.exe. All you need for you installation is tdsm[mono|microsoft].exe, tdsm.api.dll, KopiLua.dll, NLua.dll and Plugins/tdsm.core.dll.
Ensure you grab the right tdsm executable for the platform you are running it on.
